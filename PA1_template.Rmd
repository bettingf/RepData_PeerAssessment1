## Loading and preprocessing the data

First, let's read the data. We used the `unz` function to read the `activity.zip` file.

```{r}
data<-read.csv(unz("activity.zip", "activity.csv"))
```


## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

Let's plot an histogram of the total number of steps per day (with a binwidth of 1000).

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
stepsPerDay<-aggregate(steps~date, data=data, sum)
ggplot(stepsPerDay, aes(x=steps)) + geom_histogram(binwidth=1000)
``` 

The mean and median of the total number of steps taken per day are :

```{r}
c(mean(stepsPerDay$steps), median(stepsPerDay$steps))
``` 

## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
